**Comments**

1.) With this assignment I felt really comfortable using git. Compared to last week, I complete d this assignment much quicker and I think most of that had to do with feeling comfortable using git.

2.) This is the first course in the program that has touched on how to set up a site with responsive design which I am very, very interested in as all web designers should be.
